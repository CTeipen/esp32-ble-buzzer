I'm using this buzzer as a trigger for a photobooth. It is programmed to send a enter signal via bluetooth to the raspberry pi, running the photobooth software (https://photoboothproject.github.io).

Since there are "Grobhandtaster" which are pretty expensive, I created a model to print with a 3D printer.
